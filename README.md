## Car-Type-Classification Project

Overview: The Car-Type-Classification project is a deep learning-based solution designed to classify car makes and models using the Stanford Cars Dataset, a comprehensive dataset containing images of various car makes and models. The project leverages advanced deep learning architectures, including ResNet18, DenseNet, and Xception, to tackle the challenges of fine-grained classification, particularly distinguishing between visually similar car models. The system is designed to be highly accurate and robust, employing various techniques such as data preprocessing, augmentation, and comprehensive model evaluation.

## Dataset

The Stanford Cars Dataset contains over 16,000 images of 196 car makes and models.
The images vary in terms of background, lighting, and resolution, making it a challenging dataset for classification tasks.
Each image is labeled with the car's make and model, which is crucial for training the model to classify fine-grained car types.
